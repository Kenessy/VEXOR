We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
